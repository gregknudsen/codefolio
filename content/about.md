_I'm currently a software developer for Nexient, an NTTData Company and am actively seeking employment. I spend the majority of my time on the Front End of the stack, working with Angular, React as well as recently spending a lot of time with VueJS. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:dev.artist15@gmail.com) or by visiting my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/gregory-knudsen/41/b33/64) and/or [Github](https://github.com/gregknudsen) profile. Hope to hear from you soon._

I am a former professional orchestral trumpet player turned [web developer](https://www.github.com/gregknudsen) living in Indiana, PA. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. I will continue to create, but in a different way.

I'm a [family man](https://imgur.com/BAKjeyD), <span id="former">former</span> scratch golfer, lover of all (well, most) things [Apple](https://www.apple.com). I'm a [Walking Dead](https://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead), [Game of Thrones](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones), and [Leftovers](https://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers) fanatic.

I attended **Dev BootCamp** (which no longer exists, sadly) during the summer of 2014 - a truly amazing experience. While I learned a lot about various technologies at DBC (Ruby, JS), the most valuable skill I acquired was **learning how to learn**. This skill has been invaluable to me over the past five years as a professional developer - and is still evolving! Solving a problem, or better yet, finding an easier, more efficient way to solve that _same_ problem _never_ gets old!

I also graduated from [Lambda School](https://www.lambdaschool.com) (now called Bloomtech)in October 2017 - a three month, intensive web development program with a focus on front end technologies such as NodeJS and React.

After 17 years in the [Sarasota Orchestra](https://www.sarasotaorchestra.org) as its Co-Principal Trumpet, I made the transition to a career in web dev. It was bittersweet, but I know it was the right decision. From my first year at a start up in Sarasota to my current position at Nexient, it's been as fun as it has been unpredictable.

Thanks again for visiting!
