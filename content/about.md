_Thank you for visiting! I recently completed my contract as a software developer for B.E.A.T. LLC and am actively seeking employment. I spend the majority of my time on the Front End of the stack, working with Angular, React as well as recently spending a lot of time with VueJS. Don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:dev.artist15@gmail.com) or by visiting my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/gregory-knudsen/41/b33/64) and/or [Github](https://github.com/gregknudsen) profile. Hope to hear from you soon!_

I am a former professional orchestral trumpet player turned [web developer](https://www.github.com/gregknudsen) living in Indiana, PA. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. Until I decide to pick up my trumpets again (which WILL happen at some point), I will continue to create - just in different ways.

I attended **Dev BootCamp** (which no longer exists, sadly) during the summer of 2014 in New York City - a truly amazing experience. While I learned a great deal about various technologies at DBC (Ruby, JS, SQL), the most valuable skill I gained was **learning how to learn**. This has continued to be invaluable for me over the past seven plus years as a professional developer - and is still evolving! Solving problems, or better yet, finding more practical, more efficient ways to solve the _same_ problems never gets old!

I also attended [Lambda School](https://www.bloomtech.com/) (now called Bloomtech Institute of Technology) in October 2017 - another three month, intensive online web development program with a focus on technologies such as NodeJS and React.

After 17 years in the [Sarasota Orchestra](https://www.sarasotaorchestra.org) as its Co-Principal Trumpet, I transitioned to a career in web dev. Leaving the orchestra was bittersweet, but I know it was the right decision. From my first year at a start up called Rewired Solutions in Sarasota to my latest position at BEAT, it's been as fun as it has been unpredictable.

With my amazing wife, Heidi, I am also passionate about advocating for children (people) with special needs. As parents of two kiddos with special needs, we have experienced first hand the difficulties families face just to receive basic services which allow our children to thrive in school as well as in life. It's a fight we'll probably need to wage forever, but, rest assured, we will **never** stop fighting for our kids.
