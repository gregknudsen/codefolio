I am a former professional orchestral trumpet player turned [web developer](http://www.github.com/gregknudsen) living in Indiana, PA. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. I will continue to create, but in a different way.

I'm a [family man](http://imgur.com/BAKjeyD), <span id="former">former</span> scratch golfer, lover of all (well, most) things [Apple](http://www.apple.com). I'm a [Walking Dead](http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead), [Game of Thrones](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones), and [Leftovers](http://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers) fanatic.

I attended [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/locations/new-york/) during the summer of 2014 - a truly amazing experience. While I learned a lot about various technologies at DBC (Ruby, JS), the most valuable skill I acquired was **learning how to learn**. This skill has been invaluable to me over the past two years as a professional developer.
I also graduated from [Lambda School](https://www.lambdaschool.com) in October 2017 - a three month, intensive web development program with a focus on front end technologies such as NodeJS and React.
