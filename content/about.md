I am a former professional orchestral trumpet player turned [web developer](http://www.github.com/gregknudsen) living in Indiana, PA. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. I will continue to create, but in a different way.

I'm a [family man](http://imgur.com/BAKjeyD), <span id="former">former</span> scratch golfer, lover of all (well, most) things [Apple](http://www.apple.com). I'm a [Walking Dead](http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead), [Game of Thrones](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones), and [Leftovers](http://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers) fanatic.

I attended [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/locations/new-york/) during the summer of 2014 - a truly amazing experience. While I learned a lot about various technologies at DBC (Ruby, JS), the most valuable skill I acquired was **learning how to learn**. This skill has been invaluable to me over the past two years as a professional developer.
I also graduated from [Lambda School](https://www.lambdaschool.com) in October 2017 - a three month, intensive web development program with a focus on front end technologies such as NodeJS and React.

I also had the privelege to serve as a Team Lead (Head Teacher's Assistant) for Lambda School's part time program from February through September of 2018. The main focus of that full stack cirriculum remained ReactJS &amp; NodeJS. As I had learned throughout my career as a professional trumpet player, _teaching is one of the best ways of learning_. This might even be more true when it comes to web development. I probably learned more as a teacher about React/Node as a Team Lead than I did as a student.
When I got the job in Pittsburgh, it just wasn't feasible to maintain the same teaching schedule with Lambda School (24+ hours/week), so I had to resign from that position. Thankfully, I still have access to their Slack channel as well as any course material that is updated in their cirruculum. Incidentally, Lambda School has [blown up](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2019/01/08/how-lambda-school-raised-30m-to-expand-its-income-sharing-tuition-plan-for-online-coding-students/#5541ce362c68) over the past 18 months, and it's been very fun to watch.

In another fortunate turn of events, I've had the opportunity to serve as a mentor for [Trilogy Education](https://www.trilogyed.com/)'s online course. I meet with students once/week to go over what they've been working and any issues they might bring to the session. This has been incredibly satisfying, as I not only get to help people who were in my shoes about five years ago, but I've also been re-acquainted with Ruby and the Rails framework. I had not written a single line of Ruby since 2014, so there was definitely a little trepidation on my part to think I could teach it, but it was _almost_ like riding a bike again with maybe a few more potholes. I've had as many as twelve students/week, and I'm really enjoying it.
